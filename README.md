# Task Prioritization Tool

## Overview

This Python script helps you prioritize a list of tasks based on their urgency and importance. It uses the Eisenhower Matrix framework to guide you through a series of questions, asking you to compare pairs of tasks. The script then ranks the tasks and plots them on a 2D graph for visual representation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pipenv

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script.

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using Pipenv:

    ```bash
    pipenv install
    ```

    This will create a virtual environment and install the required packages, including Matplotlib.

## How to Use

1. Activate the Pipenv shell:

    ```bash
    pipenv shell
    ```

2. Run the script in your terminal:

    ```bash
    python task_prioritization.py
    ```

3. When prompted, enter the list of tasks separated by commas.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to rank the tasks by urgency and importance.

5. The script will display the ranked list of tasks and plot them on a 2D graph.
